# Calculator
For this project, I designed a basic scientific calculator within the browser. It allows for division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition of integers and decimals. It includes syntax errors, overflow errors, and divide by zero errors as well. It also contains a clear button to clear the data/screen and a delete button to remove digits from numbers. It was designed using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
